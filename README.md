**
Major Topics**
• Design, representation and implementation of data
structures
• Algorithm analysis and design: Big-O notation; time
requirement; space requirement; counting techniques
• Linear lists and multilists: application of stacks and
queues, priority queues
• Trees: binary and n-ary trees; traversals; threaded
trees; heaps; binary search trees, AVL trees, B-trees,
and general search trees
• Sets and their representation: bit map, hash table,
union-find
• Graphs: traversals; spanning trees; shortest paths
• Recursion and stack-based memory management
• Advanced sorting: heapsort, mergesort radix sort;
comparison with other sort algorithms
• Problem space searching: BFS and DFS
• NP-completeness
